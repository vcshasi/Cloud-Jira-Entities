# Cloud-Jira-Entities

This project contains the JAVA POJO classes which has been genreated using jsonschema2pojo using the response from the JIRA cloud server(7.x).

These entities can be used along with jackson to map the JSON response from JIRA server to JAVA objects using Jackson. 

Hence you need not worry about parsing your JSON response from JIRA every time in your business logic. Once you create these entities, you are all set to define your own custom business logic and need not worry about parsing logics.

Hope these entities helps the JAVA programmers code easily!! Thanks!! :smiley:
